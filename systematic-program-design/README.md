# Systematic Program Design

## 🎯 Course Overview
This course teaches a systematic approach to solving problems through programming. Rather than diving straight into code, we'll learn how to:
- Break down problems methodically
- Design solutions step by step
- Test our code systematically
- Think about data and functions in a structured way

## 📚 Learning Objectives
- [ ] Master the Design Recipe approach to problem-solving
- [ ] Learn how to work with different data types
- [ ] Understand how to design functions systematically
- [ ] Develop testing strategies
- [ ] Create well-documented, maintainable code

## 📝 Course Structure

### Part 1: How to Design Functions
- [ ] Understanding the problem
- [ ] Working with primitive data
- [ ] Writing purpose statements
- [ ] Creating examples/tests
- [ ] Implementing solutions
- [ ] Testing and refining

### Part 2: How to Design Data
- [ ] Atomic data
- [ ] Compound data
- [ ] Working with structures
- [ ] Defining types
- [ ] Using templates

### Part 3: How to Design Worlds
- [ ] Interactive programs
- [ ] Working with time
- [ ] Handling user input
- [ ] Managing program state
- [ ] Building animations

## 🔍 Design Recipe Template
For each function we design, we'll follow this template:

1. **Purpose & Signature**
   - What does the function do?
   - What are the inputs and outputs?

2. **Examples/Tests**
   - What are some example inputs?
   - What should the function return?

3. **Function Header**
   - Write the function stub
   - Include parameter names

4. **Function Body**
   - Implement the solution
   - Follow the template

5. **Testing**
   - Run the examples
   - Add more test cases

## 📊 Progress Tracking

## 🗒️ Study Notes
Remember to:
- Always start with the design recipe
- Write tests before implementing
- Keep examples simple but comprehensive
- Document your thinking process
- Review and refine your solutions

## 🎯 Next Steps
